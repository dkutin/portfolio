My portfolio showcasing all of my experiences and personal projects. Developed using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Motivation

Coming closer to graduation, I was looking for a better way to showcase my resume and progression as a computer science student and web developer to allow for new opportunities and collaborations.

## Challenges

Being new to React.js, there was a hurdle to overcome when learning the nuances of the framework, though, similiar to HTML provides more responsive and functional web design, now one of my favorite frameworks for building websites.
